=== COMPLETE Licence 

Note= it is alpha release so may be lots of bug and some functionality may be work or not. so please use on your own risk.

	Here three examples with different chart.
	
	1) COLUMN GRAPH
	
		This examples defines under columngraph.html. In this html, define one div with id =graph_121. When html loaded, there is load javascript which is written under ready function. here call method changeGraph with some parameter. parameter are define below.
		
		changeGraph(2,'graph_121',root,'json');
		
		->"2" means we want to draw column graph
		->"graph_121" means we want to draw graph under this div id.
		->"root" means we want to send data in this root variable
		->"json" means we say to graph api that root is in josn.
			here you can send data in xml format also. For that you should send "xml" in last parameter of method.
			
		changeGraph(2,'graph_121',root,'xml');	
		
		JSON Format
		
		var root= {xdata:['Ava','Bailey','PORTER','Aaron','hemant'],ydata:['1569','1052','397','241','130'],url:['#','#','#','#','#'],xlabel:'User',ylabel:'Hits',limit:'5',format:'0',color:color};
		
		xdata = json array which data shows on x-axis
		
		ydata = json array which data shows on y-axis. it is consider also value for draw graph.
		
		url = json array which is use for redirect your request or change page.
		
		xlabel = shows value as a label on x-axis
		
		ylabel = shows value as a label on y-axis
		
		limit = shows total no of record even you data array is 4 but you want to show 5 records on graph. so it is very important.
		
		format = this parameter is used for value. if your value is bytes and you want to show proper format. then give format value. (2 = show in bytes,kb,mb,gb,tb) (3=shows percentage) and other show in thousand,lakh etc.
		
		color= you can send color json array. you can fill your color on graph line. color array is following.
		
		var color = ["#74A82A", "#D55511", "#3565A1", "#A42F11", "#DC6D1C", "#0DA921", "#4C4E47", "#9F705B", "#643EA0", "#F6A615", "#CB1F26", "#B33D5A", "#EEA435", "#F6A615"];

	2) BAR GRAPH
	
		This examples defines under bargraph.html. In this html, define one div with id =graph_121. When html loaded, there is load javascript which is written under ready function. here call method changeGraph with some parameter. parameter are define below.
		
		changeGraph(1,'graph_121',root,'json');
		
		->"1" means we want to draw bar graph
		->"graph_121" means we want to draw graph under this div id.
		->"root" means we want to send data in this root variable
		->"json" means we say to graph api that root is in josn.
			here you can send data in xml format also. For that you should send "xml" in last parameter of method.
			
		changeGraph(2,'graph_121',root,'xml');	
		
		JSON Format
		
		var root= {xdata:['Ava','Bailey','PORTER','Aaron','hemant'],ydata:['1569','1052','397','241','130'],url:['#','#','#','#','#'],xlabel:'User',ylabel:'Hits',limit:'5',format:'0',color:color};
		
		xdata = json array which data shows on x-axis
		
		ydata = json array which data shows on y-axis. it is consider also value for draw graph.
		
		url = json array which is use for redirect your request or change page.
		
		xlabel = shows value as a label on x-axis
		
		ylabel = shows value as a label on y-axis
		
		limit = shows total no of record even you data array is 4 but you want to show 5 records on graph. so it is very important.
		
		format = this parameter is used for value. if your value is bytes and you want to show proper format. then give format value. (2 = show in bytes,kb,mb,gb,tb) (3=shows percentage) and other show in thousand,lakh etc.

		var color = ["#74A82A", "#D55511", "#3565A1", "#A42F11", "#DC6D1C", "#0DA921", "#4C4E47", "#9F705B", "#643EA0", "#F6A615", "#CB1F26", "#B33D5A", "#EEA435", "#F6A615"];
		
	2) Pie Chart
	
		This examples defines under piechart.html. In this html, define one div with id =graph_121. When html loaded, there is load javascript which is written under ready function. here call method changeGraph with some parameter. parameter are define below.
		
		changeGraph(3,'graph_121',root,'json');
		
		->"1" means we want to draw pie chart
		->"graph_121" means we want to draw graph under this div id.
		->"root" means we want to send data in this root variable
		->"json" means we say to graph api that root is in josn.
			here you can send data in xml format also. For that you should send "xml" in last parameter of method.
			
		changeGraph(3,'graph_121',root,'xml');	
		
		JSON Format
		
			var root= {xdata:['Ava','Bailey','PORTER','Aaron','hemant'],ydata:['1569','1052','397','241','130'],url:['#','#','#','#','#'],xlabel:'User',ylabel:'Hits',limit:'5',format:'0',color:color};
			
			xdata = json array which data defines category.
			
			ydata = json array which data defines value to category. slice divided in different category using ydata value. 
			
			url = in pie chart it is not use but must be send.
			
			xlabel = in pie chart it is not use but must be send.
			
			ylabel = in pie chart it is not use but must be send.
			
			limit = shows total no of record even you data array is 4 but you want to show 5 records on graph. so it is very important.
			
			format = this parameter is used for value. if your value is bytes and you want to show proper format. then give format value. (2 = show in bytes,kb,mb,gb,tb) (3=shows percentage) and other show in thousand,lakh etc.
			
			color= you can send color json array. you can fill your color on graph line. color array is following.
			
			var color = ["#74A82A", "#D55511", "#3565A1", "#A42F11", "#DC6D1C", "#0DA921", "#4C4E47", "#9F705B", "#643EA0", "#F6A615", "#CB1F26", "#B33D5A", "#EEA435", "#F6A615"];	
			
			
			
Graph Api

				here graph.js file is available. graph drawing logic inside in this file. you can read and understand this file and change according to your requirement. 
				
				in this file, three main method for draw graph.
				1) pieChart method draw pie chart
				2) barGraph method draw bar graph
				3) columnbarGraph method draw column graph.
				
				In future, we will add more n more graph.
				
Enjoy this api and give me review.
